my.fTelnet.ca
=============

A web based websocket / telnet client meant for connecting to BBSes.  Basically it's <a href="https://github.com/rickparrish/HtmlTerm">HtmlTerm</a>, but targeted at users instead of SysOps.<br />
<br />
The project is using plain old HTML, CSS and JavaScript so can be hosted anywhere with very little effort.<br />
<br />
Some features are powered by jQuery (1.11.0) and the layout is Bootstrap (3.1.1) with a Bootswatch theme (Cyborg).

Features

Cross-platform (just need a browser supporting HTML5 Canvas and WebSockets)<br />
YModem-G file transfers<br />
ANSI-BBS emulation<br />
Variable font size based on window/device size<br />
Scrollback buffer<br />
Dialing directory<br />
