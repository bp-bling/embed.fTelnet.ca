        <p><strong>My fTelnet</strong> is a web based application meant for connecting to BBSes.  It uses some fairly recent features of HTML5, so let's test and ensure everything will work for you:</p>

        <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Feature</th>
                    <th>Supported?</th>
                    <th>Notes</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Canvas</td>
                    <td id="tdCanvasSupported"></td>
                    <td><strong>Required!</strong> Canvas is how the output of the connection gets displayed.  Without it, you can't see what the BBS is trying to show you!</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>WebSocket</td>
                    <td id="tdWebSocketSupported"></td>
                    <td><strong>Required!</strong> WebSocket is the protocol used to talk to the remote server.  Without it, you can't connect to any BBSes!</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>WebSocket binaryType</td>
                    <td id="tdWebSocketBinaryTypeSupported"></td>
                    <td><strong>Required!</strong> binaryType is a property that kicks WebSocket into binary mode.  Without it, I'd have to do a lot more work on the server side of things, and I'm just too lazy to do that unless I really have to!</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Web Storage</td>
                    <td id="tdWebStorageSupported"></td>
                    <td><strong>Optional</strong> Web Storage is sort of like Cookies, but WAY better.  Without it, your recent connections and dialing directory won't be saved the next time you visit this site.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>If you see any <span class="text-danger">Nope!</span> labels above, that means your browser doesn't fully support the features used by My fTelnet and you should consider upgrading your browser.</p>
