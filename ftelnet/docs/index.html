        <h2 id="Managed">Managed vs Unmanaged</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>fTelnet comes in both Managed and Unmanaged versions, and I can't stress enough how much I recommend using the managed version.</p>
            <p>Why do I recommend the managed version?  Because it's pretty much foolproof (no offense intended!), and doesn't require you to keep anything up to date, I do all that for you.</p>
            <p>So if you want to stop reading now and go try the managed version instead, head on over to the <a href="http://embed.ftelnet.ca/wizard.html">Embed Wizard</a>.  Seriously, you'll be up and running in under 5 minutes.  It's awesome.</p>

            <hr />

            <p>I see you're still reading, so I guess you don't want to use the managed version...that sucks because I put a lot of effort into getting that up and running!</p>
            <p>Anyway, before you 100% decide which version to run, check of these differences:</p>

        <h2 id="Support">How to get support</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>Email is the only way to get ahold of me.  Usually I'm pretty good about answering quickly, but sometimes I need a break from the computer and it may take a day or two.</p>
            <p>Don't forget to read this entire document and <a href="../demos/index.html">check out the demos</a> before contacting me.  I created the managed version to make things easy for you, so if you're deciding to use the unmanaged version that tells me you're looking for a challenge, and so you need to put some effort into said challenge before asking for help.</p>

        <h2 id="Install">How to install</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>Installing is pretty simple.  If you're reading this that means you've already downloaded and extracted the archive, so just put all these files into an fTelnet directory on your webserver and you're good to go.</p>
        </div>
        <a href="#TOC">Back to top</a>
        <hr />

        <h2 id="Use">How to use</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>Using fTelnet is almost as easy as installing it was.  First you need to include the correct files.  Assuming you have an index.html in your document root, and fTelnet in a subdirectory called fTelnet, you can do that by putting this in your &lt;head> section:</p>
            <code>
                &lt;!-- CSS used to style the buttons/statusbar/keyboard/etc --><br />
                &lt;link href="fTelnet/fTelnet.css" rel="stylesheet"><br />
                &lt;link href="" rel="stylesheet" id="fTelnetKeyboardCss">
                <br />
                &lt;!-- Javascript used to power fTelnet --><br />
                &lt;script src="fTelnet/fTelnet.min.js" id="fTelnetScript">&lt;/script><br />
            </code>
            <p>Now that you have the support files loading, you need to create a placeholder where you'll render the client, and then initialize it:</p>
            <code>
                &lt;div id="fTelnetContainer">&lt;/div><br />
                &lt;script><br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; fTelnet.Init();
                &lt;/script><br />
            </code>
            <p>That should now get you up and running.  Want a more complete example?  <a href="../demos/index.html">Check out the demos</a></p>

        <h2 id="Customize">How to customize</h2>
        <div class="well">
            <p>Ahh, now we get to the meat of the document.  You've installed fTelnet, you've got it up and running, and now you want to customize it (what, you mean you DIDN'T want it to just connect to my server?!?)</p>
            <p>So here's a complete (at the time of this writing, hopefully I'll remember to keep it up to date in the future!) list of variables that you can customize.  You should assign values to these variables right before you call fTelnet.Init().  You should be able to assign them after you call fTelnet.Init(), but some of them may cause flicker (ie font or screen size changes), so best to do it before.</p>

                        <p>Useful for servers that break the telnet spec and send "\n" instead of "\r\n" to end a line</p>
